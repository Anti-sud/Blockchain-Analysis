**🔍 On-Chain Theft Forensic Analysis**

This project focuses on forensic analysis of an on-chain theft scenario. The main objective was to trace the flow of funds from a suspected exploiter wallet by leveraging blockchain transaction data through an API interface.


**🎯 Objective**

The primary aim of this project is to fetch and analyze transaction data associated with a specific exploiter wallet address. By tracking wallet activity over a defined block range, the analysis aims to detect the path of stolen assets and understand how they were moved across wallets.


**🔧 What Was Done**

- Queried blockchain transactions using a provided API endpoint
- Collected and stored transaction data for analysis
- Identified key addresses involved in the fund transfer chain
- Mapped transaction relationships to detect the flow of stolen assets
- Visualized and interpreted fund movement behavior


**🧠 Skills Demonstrated**

- Blockchain data querying
- API integration
- Data analysis and filtering
- Financial fraud detection techniques
- Python scripting and Jupyter Notebook usage


**📌 Learning Outcomes**

This project enhances understanding of how blockchain forensics can be used to identify fraudulent activity. It demonstrates practical skills in working with decentralized data sources, writing automated scripts to trace fund flows, and drawing meaningful inferences from on-chain behavior.
